# Lab 3
Play around with JavaScript

## In this lab you will accomplish the following
 - Use JavaScript to build and run your first program

## Please write the code for these three functions:
 - getMaximum(num1, num2): return the largest of the two numbers
 - getFactorial(n): return n!, which is for example 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
 - createStudent(name, id, grades) which returns a student object with the properties: name (string), id (number), and grades (an array)

## Please fill out the blank stubs of the functions in the js/script.js file and run the HTML page
 - Please run index.html to check your work
 - Right click on the page and select "Inspect Element". Then click on the console tab at the bottom of the page to see any errors you have.
 - If it runs successfully, you should see a series of prompts that use the three function that you have written successfully
 - Once you have written the three functions successfully and the prompts run successfully you are done
